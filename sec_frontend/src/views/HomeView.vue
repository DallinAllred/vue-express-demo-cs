    <h2>Welcome to The Security Project</h2>
    <p>
      As we become a more digital society the role of Cybersecurity is expected to dramatically increase in scope. This website, which started as a school project, is intended to provide an introduction
      to the world of Cybersecurity. Starting with some basic historical encryption schemes and SQL Injection I hope to see it eventually expand to provide a well rounded view of the topic, along with
      functional examples of each concept.
